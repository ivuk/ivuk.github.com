The AppArmor security model(1/3)

A file gets accessed via open(2), mkdir(2)...
Kernel looks up the location of the object
The result of the lookup is a pair of (dentry, vfsmount) kernel-internal objects
AppArmor uses the (dentry, vfsmount) pair to compute the pathname of the file
AppArmor checks if the current profile contains rules that match the pathname and if they allow the requested access
Accesses that are not explicitly allowed are denied
