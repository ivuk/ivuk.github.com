What we learned so far or what I may have forgot to mention (1/4)

SELinux "knows" if you are a user or an application
Everybody gets their user, role, type (and MLS)
We have RBAC, TE and MLS
Userspace tools such as ps,ls,... have an additional -Z parameter that shows security contexts
Error messages end up in /var/log/messages or /var/log/audit/audit.log
